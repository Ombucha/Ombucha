<i>Mu Cephei or "The Garnet Star" is a red supergiant in the constellation Cepheus. You can see this star with the naked eye under good seeing conditions of the night sky. The star is more than 100,000 times brighter than the Sun and is one of the largest visible stars at a radius 1,000 times that of the sun. I included a large portion of the star field where the Garnet Star is located so you could see how this star dominates the night sky with its deep red or garnet color and relatively large size compared to the surrounding stars.</i>
