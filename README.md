<i>Nothing like watching lightning with a bunch of volcanoes in the background to remind one of their place in the universe! Like any sane photographer, I decided to fly my drone with a fearsome thunderstorm fast approaching. Totally worth it. This is near the Deschutes River in central Oregon. In the background are a chain of volcanoes in the Cascade Mountains, including Mt. Bachelor and one of the Three Sisters mountains.</i>
